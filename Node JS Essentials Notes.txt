Differences of Apache and Nodejs
=============================
Clear differences with Apache is
that it is multithreaded
Node is single Threaded Applications
So it has the freedom to work (Multitask)
with the same thread for multiple requests
Apache has something callled Blocking that
prevents from other requests been formed
=============================
That is how the datastore or the file System works
Thus the nodejs is simple single threaded
Node JS is Asynchronous and non-blocking event driven io
Event are store and recorded in a queue.And raised in that order
