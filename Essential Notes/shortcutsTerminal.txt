So WE need some basic terminal commands
First to Open a Directory
    So In Ubuntu basically to do so we need to get it from the nautilis
        $ nautilis .            //this is Ubuntu or debian
        $ gnome-open .          // this should also work
        $ xdg-open .            // this should also work fine with the gui    
        $ open .                // in Mac
        $ explorer .            // this is windows
