So WE need some basic terminal commands
First to Open a Directory
    So In Ubuntu basically to do so we need to get it from the nautilis
        $ nautilis .            //this is Ubuntu or debian
        $ gnome-open .          // this should also work
        $ xdg-open .            // this should also work fine with the gui    
        $ open .                // in Mac
        $ explorer .            // this is windows
To Open a site from the terminal 
    We need a webbrowser of choice
        either it can be firefox or Chrome
            $ firefox http://www.google.com // this should fireup firefox
            $ chrome http://www.google.com  // this should fireup the chrome

To Open Up a new session of the terminal from the terminal
    $ gnome-terminal
    // this should return you another session of the terminal
